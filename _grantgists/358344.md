                Pay close attention to the key themes of the proposal and especially
                the scientific areas of research the funding opportunity is concerned
                with. In addition, summarize non-goals of the funding opportunity,
                i.e., scientific research that the opportunity specifically will NOT
                fund.  In summary, what will this proposal fund? What will it not
                fund? Answer both of these questions clearly.

                content: '**Summary**: This opportunity seeks fundamental, innovative
                    research in advanced scientific computing, with priority given
                    to mathematical and computational breakthroughs that significantly
                    extend our understanding of extreme-scale computing systems. It
                    specifically supports basic research to advance knowledge in areas
                    such as high-performance computing (HPC) software, hardware, algorithms,
                    and data management, rather than near-term commercial applications.
                    It will *not* fund research aimed primarily at current commercial
                    needs or incremental product development, nor will it support
                    any project lacking a clear emphasis on fundamental science and
                    open dissemination.'

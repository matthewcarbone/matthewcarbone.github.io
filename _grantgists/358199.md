Description: 'The DOE SC program in Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) hereby announces
    its interest in receiving new or renewal single-investigator or small-group applications
    to carry out hypothesis-driven frontier-level research in basic plasma science
    and engineering. The FES Discovery Plasma Science: Plasma Science and Technology&#8211;General
    Plasma Science (GPS) program supports research at the frontiers of basic plasma
    science (including astrophysical, dusty, and low temperature plasma). GPS topical
    areas are broad and include but are not limited to: understanding the onset of
    magnetic reconnection and trigger mechanisms for explosive instabilities in nature
    (solar flares, geomagnetic storms) and in the laboratory; magnetic dynamo processes
    by which magnetic fields are generated in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas;
    mechanisms by which energy is transferred between fields, flows, and particles;
    how coherent structures are created through the self-fields of the plasma and
    its interactions with waves; coupling of dusty plasma in strong magnetic fields;
    and plasma chemistry and processes related to interaction of plasma with surfaces,
    materials, or biomaterials. Through the support of this research, the GPS program
    plays a key role in training the next generation of plasma scientists and engineers.'

                the scientific areas of research the funding opportunity is concerned
                with. In addition, summarize non-goals of the funding opportunity,
                i.e., scientific research that the opportunity specifically will NOT
                fund.  In summary, what will this proposal fund? What will it not
                fund? Answer both of these questions clearly.

                content: This funding opportunity supports fundamental research in
                    basic plasma science and engineering, emphasizing innovative approaches
                    that advance our understanding of plasma physics. It will not
                    fund near-term technology demonstrations, duplicative research
                    already funded, or projects lacking a strong fundamental research
                    focus. Proposals must clearly articulate how they will expand
                    the scientific knowledge base in plasma science rather than merely
                    applying existing technologies.

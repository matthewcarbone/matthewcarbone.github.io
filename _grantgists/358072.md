Description: The DOE SC program in Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) hereby announces its
    interest in applications for a Private Facility Research (PFR) program to support
    public research utilizing world leading experimental capabilities owned by private
    companies. Along the path to constructing Fusion Pilot Plants (FPPs), many private
    fusion companies are constructing interim small-to-large scale research facilities
    to establish the scientific and/or technological basis for their chosen fusion
    concepts. Since the research on these interim facilities is largely foundational
    in nature, the mission overlap between the public and private sectors is large.
    Consistent with the FES Building Bridges Vision[1], the PFR program serves as
    a bridge from boldly delivered private sector hardware back to foundational research
    expertise residing in the public sector. Through the program, public researchers
    will conduct open peer-reviewed science at private facilities, to enhance the
    scientific rigor and breadth of the existing private efforts for the mutual benefit
    of all involved. As with all thriving high-tech industries, a strong connection
    to foundational research is essential.

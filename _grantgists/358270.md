Description: The DOE SC programs in Basic Energy Sciences (BES) and Advanced Scientific
    Computing Research (ASCR) announce their interest in receiving applications from
    interdisciplinary teams to establish partnerships under the Scientific Discovery
    through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program in specific targeted topic areas that
    relate to the BES and ASCR missions. Targeted topics are described in the Supplementary
    Information section below. This Announcement invites new research applications
    for the SciDAC Partnerships in BES that enable or accelerate scientific discovery
    employing DOE High-Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. For the purpose of
    this Announcement, the term &#8220;DOE HPC&#8221; has been expanded to include
    the high-performance production computational systems at the National Energy Research
    Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility
    (ALCF), the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), or similar DOE computing
    facilities. DOE HPC includes the exascale machines Frontier and Aurora.

                    The NOFO specifies an annual award range of $1,000,000 to $2,000,000
                    for academic institutions and $1,500,000 to $2,500,000 for DOE
                    National Laboratories. Awards are anticipated to span a 4-year
                    project period. Continuation funding depends on factors such as
                    congressional appropriations and satisfactory progress toward
                    project objectives.'

                will significantly reduce their chances of getting funded, or disqualify
                them all together. Some examples of this might be failing to include

                content: Common mistakes include submitting materials in the wrong
                    portal or format, failing to attach required documents in the
                    correct fields, overlooking page limits, or including disallowed
                    personal data. These can be avoided by thoroughly reading the
                    instructions, using checklists to ensure all required content
                    is included, and submitting materials well before deadlines. Carefully
                    verifying completeness, correctness, and adherence to all specifications
                    is key to avoiding disqualification.

Description: Isotopes are high-priority commodities of strategic importance for the
    Nation and are essential in medical diagnosis and treatment, discovery science,
    national security, industrial processes, advanced manufacturing, space exploration,
    communications, biology, archaeology, quantum information science, clean energy,
    environmental science, and other fields. Isotopes can directly enable emerging
    technologies and contribute to the economic, technical, and scientific strength
    of the United States. The DOE Office of Science Program for Isotope R&amp;D and
    Production (also referred to as the DOE Isotope Program or DOE IP) routinely funds
    research and development (R&amp;D) in isotope science to advance fundamental understanding
    and develop cutting edge and efficient technologies for enriching, producing,
    processing, recycling, and purifying radioactive and stable isotopes in short
    supply. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is narrowly focused on topics
    involving AI/ML, enhanced processing chemistry used in matter phase changes, and
    separation science. Applications incorporating effective ways to train the next
    generation of personnel with essential knowledge and skills related to the production,
    processing, and purification of radioactive and enriched stable isotopes are strongly
    encouraged.

                with. In addition, summarize non-goals of the funding opportunity,

                    cost-effective technologies for enriching, producing, processing,
                    recycling, and purifying isotopes in short supply, particularly
                    through robotics, AI/ML, and advanced manufacturing methods that
                    boost efficiency and safety. It aims to expand and improve isotope
                    production capabilities without duplicating existing work, emphasizing
                    cutting-edge techniques to serve national needs. Proposals lacking
                    alignment with these isotope-focused objectives or duplicating
                    prior R&D (and thus offering no new advances) will not be funded.

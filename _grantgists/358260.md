                opportunity  (either as the lead or otherwise) and if so, in what

                content: DOE/NNSA national laboratories cannot apply as the lead institution
                    or be listed as subrecipients under this funding opportunity.
                    However, scientific staff at these laboratories may still participate
                    as project team members if the cognizant DOE/NNSA Contracting
                    Officer provides written authorization, and any associated funding
                    would be executed via the DOE field work authorization system
                    instead of through a grant award. In other words, lab staff can
                    collaborate on proposed projects, but the lab itself cannot directly
                    receive or manage the grant.

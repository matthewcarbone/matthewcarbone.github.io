AdditionalInformationOnEligibility: In accordance with 2 CFR 910.126, Competition,
    eligibility for award is restricted to U.S.   Institutions of Higher Education,
    DOE National Laboratories (listed at https://www.energy.gov/national-laboratories),
    and institutions operating SC Scientific User Facilities (listed at https://science.osti.gov/User-Facilities).    This
    eligibility restriction is intended to create an opportunity for the most promising
    scientists who are (a) early in their careers, (b) in positions with sufficient
    permanence to support independent research efforts, and (c) for investigators
    not at DOE-affiliated institutions, in positions that require working with the
    students who will become the scientific workforce of the future.

Description: The Office of Science&#8217;s (SC) mission is to deliver scientific discoveries
    and major scientific tools to transform our understanding of nature and advance
    the energy, economic, and national security of the United States (U.S.). SC is
    the Nation&#8217;s largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences
    and the lead Federal agency supporting fundamental scientific research for our
    Nation&#8217;s energy future.&#183; Science for energy, economic and national
    security&#8213;building a foundation of scientific and technical knowledge to
    spur discoveries and innovations for advancing the Department&#8217;s mission.
    SC supports a wide range of funding modalities from single principal investigators
    to large team-based activities to engage in fundamental research on energy production,
    conversion, storage, transmission, and use, and on our understanding of the earth
    systems.&#183; The frontiers of science&#8212;exploring nature&#8217;s mysteries
    from the study of fundamental subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules that are
    the building blocks of the materials of our universe and everything in it to the
    DNA, proteins, and cells that are the building blocks of life. Each of the programs
    in SC supports research probing the most fundamental disciplinary questions.The
    21st Century tools of science&#8212;providing the nation&#8217;s researchers with
    28 state-of-the-art national scientific user facilities, the most advanced tools
    of modern science, propelling the U.S. to the forefront of science, technology
    development, and deployment through innovation.SC is an established leader of
    the U.S. scientific discovery and innovation enterprise. Over the decades, SC
    investments and accomplishments in basic research and enabling research capabilities
    have provided the foundations for new technologies, businesses, and industries,
    making significant contributions to our nation&#8217;s economy, national security,
    and quality of life.

                    The Early Career Research Program is known to be highly competitive,
                    typically funding only a fraction of submitted proposals. Because
                    the program award amounts tend to be substantial and support multiple
                    years of research, many strong applications vie for limited slots.
                    Consequently, applicants should expect a rigorous selection process
                    with relatively low overall success rates.'

[Secure Shell (ssh)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh) is the premier software for enabling secure file and data transfers over arbitrary networks. As stated in the linked ssh homepage, it is indeed ubiquitous in almost every data center on the planet. If you do high-performance computing, you've almost certainly "ssh'd" into the login node on that computer, to access it. You might even have a workstation somewhere else (perhaps on your college campus, or employer's office) that, depending on the network setup, you can access remotely via ssh. It is a key tool for the computational scientist or software engineer.

In this post, I will go over a few canonical examples of how one can and should use ssh to be productive in their workflows. We'll cover the following points:


```bash
ssh -v
```


```python
def hi(there):
    return there
```


test `code`

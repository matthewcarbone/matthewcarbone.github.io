In this blog post, I've created a simple Q/A for mentors who are interested in supervising a Computational Science Graduate Fellow (CSGF) during their practicum, a brief summary of which can be found [here](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/doe-lab-practicum). At the time of writing this, I am the [practicum coordinator](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/doe-lab-practicum/brookhaven) for Brookhaven National Lab, and therefore the primary point of contact for mentors wishing to supervise CSGFs during their practicum. You can find my contact information on my [staff page](https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mcarbone).

  Hi and welcome to my website! I am a <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mcarbone">staff scientist</a> at Brookhaven National Laboratory's <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/compsci/">Computational Science Initiative</a>. Previously, I received my PhD in chemical physics from the <a href="https://www.chem.columbia.edu">Chemistry Department at Columbia University</a>, where I was a member of <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/reichman/index.html"> David Reichman's group</a>. During this time, I was a <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow</a>, which allowed me to study both data-driven techniques and fundamental condensed matter theory.
</p>
<p>
  I live with my wife, Sarah, and our cat, <a href="/cat.html">Lucy</a>, in Manhattan (New York City). In my free time, I love going to plays and musicals (see <a href="/shows.html">here</a> for some of the ones we've seen recently!), watching the Yankees and Giants and exploring all of the excellent restaurants here in the city.
</p>
<p>
  My primary role is to be a research "force multiplier": I am an expert in condensed matter theory and machine learning, but my differentiating capability is my fluency in multiple "scientific languages". I am an expert software engineer, data scientist and physicist. As such, I bridge the gaps between groups of people with wildly different areas of expertise so that we can more effectively secure funding and do better science. I am also committed to a more equitable scientific community, and have over 10 years of experience and active participation in outreach, education, workforce development and DEIA (diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility) efforts. Please see a summary of my activities, and my outreach statement <a href="/outreach.html">here</a>.

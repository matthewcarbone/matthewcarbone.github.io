        <i><span class="volume_highlight">About&mdash;</span></i> My name's Matt, I'm a condensed matter physicist by training. I work on problems in applied machine learning for science, software and automation. Currently I am a <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mcarbone">staff scientist</a> at Brookhaven National Laboratory's <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/compsci/">Computational Science Initiative</a>. I live with my wife, Sarah, and our cat, <a href="/cat.html">Lucy</a>, in Manhattan (New York City). In my free time, I love going to plays and musicals (see <a href="/shows.html">here</a> for some of the ones we've seen recently!), watching the Yankees and Giants and exploring all of the excellent restaurants here in the city.

        <i><span class="volume_highlight">CV&mdash;</span></i> My CV/resume is available upon request. It's just too hard to keep that updated. My publications are kept up to date and can be found <a href="/publications">here</a>.

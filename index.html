  Hi and welcome to my website! I am a <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mcarbone">staff scientist</a> at Brookhaven National Laboratory's <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/compsci/">Computational Science Initiative</a>. Previously, I received my PhD in chemical physics from the <a href="https://www.chem.columbia.edu">Chemistry Department at Columbia University</a>, where I was a member of <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/reichman/index.html"> David Reichman's group</a>. During this time, I was a <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow</a>, which allowed me to study both data-driven techniques and fundamental condensed matter theory.
</p>
<p>
  I live with my wife, Sarah, and our cat, <a href="/cat.html">Lucy</a>, in Manhattan (New York City). In my free time, I love going to plays and musicals (see <a href="/shows.html">here</a> for some of the ones we've seen recently!), watching the Yankees and Giants and exploring all of the excellent restaurants here in the city.

<h2>Professional summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
  <i><span class="volume_highlight">Research-</span></i> My primary role is to be a research "force multiplier": I am an expert in condensed matter theory and machine learning, but my differentiating capability is my fluency in multiple "scientific languages". I bridge the gaps between groups of people with wildly different areas of expertise so that we can more effectively secure funding and do better science. Check out my <a href="/publications.html">publications</a> for more details.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i><span class="volume_highlight">Software-</span></i> I don't just write code for science, I love creating quality, reusable, documented and continuously tested/deployed software. Current languages I use (and some highlights of packages I've created) are:
  <ul>
  <li>
    Python (expert, >8 years experience): <a href="https://github.com/AI-multimodal/Lightshow">Lightshow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matthewcarbone/GGCE">GGCE</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    C++ (advanced, >5 years experience): <a href="https://github.com/matthewcarbone/hdspin">hdspin</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Rust (currently learning): <a href="https://github.com/matthewcarbone/doubletime">Doubletime</a>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <i><span class="volume_highlight">Outreach-</span></i> I am committed to a more equitable scientific community, and have over 10 years of experience and active participation in outreach, education, workforce development and DEIA (diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility) efforts. Please see a summary of my activities, and my outreach statement <a href="/outreach.html">here</a>.

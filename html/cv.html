<h1 id="page_header">CV</h1>

I am a computational scientist, software engineer and trained condensed matter physicist. With my collaborators spanning multiple national laboratories and universities, I have developed some of the world's first deep learning models for x-ray absorption spectroscopy, written a significant amount of open source software for computational spectroscopy, and made contributions to fully autonomous experiment orchestration and data storage solutions at the National Synchrotron Lightsource II at Brookhaven National Laboratory. I have over 8 years of experience in scientific research, software development and machine learning, and have made a career of working with diverse teams of scientists to tackle exceptionally challenging problems.

Note: this is currently a work in progress. Please email me for my up-to-date CV! My publications can be found in the navigation bar above.
